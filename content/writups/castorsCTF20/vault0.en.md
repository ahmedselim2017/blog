We can see the `checkpass()` function first converts string to hex and then checks
the values by hardcoded flag. We can easily get the flag by formatting the hardcoded
values and then converting them to string with python.

```python
_input = [0x63, 0x61, 0x73, 0x74,
          0x6f, 0x72, 0x73, 0x43, 0x54,
          0x46, 0x7b, 0x72, 0x31, 0x78,
          0x54, 0x79, 0x5f,
          0x6d, 0x31, 0x6e,
          0x75, 0x74, 0x33, 0x73, 0x5f, 0x67, 0x74,
          0x5f, 0x73, 0x31, 0x78, 0x74, 0x79, 0x5f, 0x6d,
          0x31, 0x6e, 0x75, 0x74, 0x33,
          0x73, 0x7d]
for i in _input:
    print(chr(i), end="")
```

**Flag:** `castorsCTF{r1xTy_m1nut3s_gt_s1xty_m1nut3s}`
